      <p>4.7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; protect ourselves, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or</p>

      <p>4.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing with affiliated companies We share information we collect with affiliated companies and, in some cases, with prospective affiliates.

      <p>4.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When using the services of any third party we will ensure, contractually, that the third party will employ suitable technical and organisational measures to protect your Personal Information, as required by applicable law.</p>

      <p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The legal grounds for processing your Personal Information</p>

      <p>We collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable laws. The legal bases depend on the services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:</p>

      <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we need it to provide you Drops Drives, including to operate the DropsTec Hub, provide customer support and personalised features and to protect the safety and security of the DropsTec Hub;</p>

      <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the DropsTec Hub and Drops Drives and to protect our legal rights and interests;</p>

      <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or</p>

      <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we need to process your Personal Information to comply with a legal obligation.</p>

      <p>If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use although, in some cases, this may mean you will no longer be able to use the DropsTec Hub or a Drops Drive.</p>

      <p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retention</p>

      <p>6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We require your user profile information in order to grant you access to the DropsTec Hub and/or to provide a Drops Drive ("the Purpose") as well as for invoicing purposes. We retain such information for as long as you maintain your account with us.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once information is no longer necessary for the Purpose or to enable customer support, to enhance the user experience or for other operational purposes, we will take steps to prevent access to or use of such information for any purpose other than compliance with these requirements or for purposes of safety, security and fraud prevention and detection.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may request deletion of your account at any time through our customer support channels.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may also retain certain information if it is necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users' safety and security.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>6.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marketing material opt-out&nbsp;</p>

      <p>You can also opt-out of receiving emails and other messages from us by following the instructions in those messages. Please note that if you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional messages, such as order confirmations.</p>

      <p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to access and control your Personal Information</p>

      <p>7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may request information from us about our treatment of your Personal Information.</p>

      <p>7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have the right to request rectification and/or erasure of your Personal Information or restriction of processing concerning you, or to object to the processing of your Personal Information, as well as the right to data portability.</p>

      <p>7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To exercise your rights, you can contact our Information Officer at support@drops.org.za.</p>

      <p>7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, DropsTec Hub does not currently respond to browser DNT signals. You can use the range of other tools we provide to control the collection of Personal Information and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving marketing from us as described below.</p>

      <p>7.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have any compliant about the manner in which we handle your Personal Information you may lodge a complaint with the South African Information Regulator (inforeg@justice.gov.za).</p>

      <p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cross-Border Data Transfers</p>

      <p>Our business processes may increasingly go beyond the borders of South Africa. Consequently, your Personal Information may be subject to cross border data transfers. When making cross border transfers of Personal Information we will ensure that the third party processor will contractually commit to employ suitable technical and organisational measures to protect your Personal Information as required by the applicable Data Protection Legislation, (hereinafter referred to as “Supplier Data Processing Agreements”) as well as other suitable safeguards recognised by applicable Data Protection Legislation.</p>

      <p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Security of your Personal Information</p>

      <p>We are committed to protecting your Personal Information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure by using a combination of physical, administrative and technical safeguards and contractually requiring that third parties to whom we disclose your personal information do the same. Whilst we will make every effort to secure our Apps and websites, you should note that the internet is not completely secure; thus when you submit or post Personal Information online, you should be aware that we cannot guarantee the security of any Personal Information that you submit or post online.</p>

      <p>10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Direct marketing</p>

      <p>10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can choose whether you wish to receive marketing communications from us by email, SMS, social media platforms or phone. Even when you have agreed to this, you may opt out of receiving future marketing materials from us at any time and manage your communication preferences by:</p>

      <p>10.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; following the unsubscribe instructions included in each marketing email or SMS text message from us, or</p>

      <p>10.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sending an email to support@drops.org.za including your details and a description of the marketing material you no longer wish to receive from us. We will comply with your request as soon as is reasonably practicable.</p>

      <p>10.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you opt out of receiving marketing related communications from us, we may still send you administrative messages as part of your ongoing use of the DropsTec Hub and/or the Drops Delivery Services.</p>
